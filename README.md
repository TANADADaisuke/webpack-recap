# Webbpack Express Example App

The goal of this repo is be an example of a basic but functional app built on Express and Webpack.

This is my handwritten memo for [fend-webpack-content](https://github.com/TANADADaisuke/fend-webpack-content) and [fend-webpack-sass](https://github.com/TANADADaisuke/fend-webpack-sass). For more detail about this course, please see these links.

## What we will cover

We will cover:

- Webpack entry point
- Webpack output and dist folder
- Webpack Loaders
- Webpack Plugins
- Webpack Mode
- Tools for convenient Webpack development

## Get Up and Running

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start``` to start the app
- this app runs on localhost:3000, but you can of course edit that in server.js
